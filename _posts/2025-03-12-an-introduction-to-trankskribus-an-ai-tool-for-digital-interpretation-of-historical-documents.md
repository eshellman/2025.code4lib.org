title: "An Introduction to Trankskribus: An AI tool for digital interpretation of historical documents"
---
The Media Preservation team at Emory University has begun experimenting with the Transkribus tool, a digital interpretation tool used to analyze textual documents and provide transcriptions. Transkribus uses an AI approach that incorporates analysis models that users can train to better recognize specific line patterns and text format or handwriting styles. For large collections that use one individual’s handwriting, or a series of geographic-specific items, trainable models can increase the accuracy of the program significantly. We have worked with a small variety of collections using this tool, such as a Civil War collection that has a very large number of handwritten materials from an area with low literacy and askew line patterns, but also containing insightful information. Another example collection is the Maud Gonne and William B. Yeates Correspondence, which provides a unique collection where there is substantial existing transcription and a consistent handwriting style. Our presentation will focus on an introduction to the Transkribus Tool, our experience with “getting up to speed” with it, and a summary of the value we’ve gotten from its use and the various lessons learned should others wish to try it out.
