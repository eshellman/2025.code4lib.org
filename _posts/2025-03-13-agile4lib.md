Although often thought of as a “software methodology,” Agile is more of a mindset, driven by iteration and continuous learning. In this workshop we will introduce participants to the origins of agile, its frameworks and mindset, the How and Why of incremental development and the importance of delivering the most value as a north star.

We'll also discuss some of the ways that Agile can be adapted for library culture. Much of the training materials about using Agile assume a corporate setting, but there are ways to make it work in a library context.

This will pair well with [Fail4Lib]({% post_url 2025-03-13-fail4lib-2025 %}).
